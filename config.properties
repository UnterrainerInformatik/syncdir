# Here you can specify how the program behaves. We have several modes
# at your disposal which are described in detail below.
#
# Currently supported modes are:
#  sync			Does a synchronization run using all provided parameters.
#  analyze		When specified without 'sync' it just analyzes the directories
#				without doing any changes. When specified in addition to the
#				'sync' parameter, it prints out the analysis before doing
#				changes.
#  delete		Optional parameter for the 'sync'-mode.
#				When specified deletes directories and files present on the
#				target, but not present on the source. When not specified the
#				program just accumulates data in the target directory, never
#				deleting obsolete files or directories.
#
# The order of the words doesn't matter.
mode = analyze sync delete
#mode = sync
#mode = sync analyze
#mode = sync delete
#mode = sync analyze delete

# This option manipulates escaping when it comes to paths. Use windows or mac.
os = windows

# This is the target-directory where the program will copy the files to. 
targetDir = //babylon5/Movies3/target

# The directories where your source-files and directories are located.
#
# IMPORTANT FOR ALL PATH-SPECIFICATIONS:
# Always use forward slashes ('/') like in the examples below!
# Don't ever use backslashes ('\') since there are multiple issues with the
# JVM on different systems (non-windows) causing the command-line calls
# to fail!
#
# If you want to specify more than one, just add another sourceDirs-parameter
# (same name) below the current one.
sourceDirs = //babylon5/Movies3/source1
sourceDirs = //babylon5/Movies3/source2
#sourceDirs = C:/
#sourceDirs = G:/
#sourceDirs = H:/DVDs/
